                Did you receive a call asking you to buy “insurance” in order to
                get a loan? It is a scam. We do NOT call consumers asking for
                any sort of “insurance”. We do NOT make outbound calls to
                consumers, period. We do NOT issue loans but instead will
                attempt to connect you with a lender who could issue you a loan.
                This connection service is FREE to consumers. We do NOT charge
                consumers any fees. Anyone calling you on the phone who says
                otherwise, are not employees or agents of PockBox, please don’t
                send them money.

                We do NOT send out SMS or text messages to consumers. We attempt

                Because we are not lenders ourselves, we are unable to
                pre-approve anyone. Anyone sending you SMS or text does so
                without our permission and against our terms & conditions.
