              A common question we get is: How much will I be charged for taking
              out a personal loan? The answer is simple and a bit complicated at
              the same time. Your fee will be based on the APR (Annual
              Percentage Rate) of your loan.

              Please note: PockBox is not a lender and does not provide
              short-term loans but refers consumers to lenders who may provide
              such loans. PockBox is unable to supply you with an exact APR
              (Annual Percentage Rate) that you will be charged if you are
              approved for a loan. APRs vary according to the information
              supplied by you in your loan request and your lender. You will be
              given the APR, loan fees, and other terms by your lender when you
              are redirected to your loan agreement in the loan request process.
            </p>
            <p class="section__content--para">
              The APR on a short term loan can range from 200% to 2,290%
              depending on the loan amount, the duration of the loan, loan fees
              incurred, late payment fees, non-payment fees, loan renewal
              actions, and other factors. Keep in mind that the APR range is not
              your finance charge and your finance charge will be disclosed
              later on.

              PockBox is not a lender and does not charge any fees for its

              consumer with specific terms, conditions, and practices prior to
              the consumer's acceptance of the loan. We recommend that you
              carefully review the terms and conditions of any loan offer
              presented to you.

              When you accept the terms and conditions for a loan offer, you are

              amount of time shown in the documents supplied by your lender.
              Additional fees or charges by your lender may be applicable in the
              event that you are unable to repay your loan in full or if you
              make a late payment. PockBox cannot predict the amount of the fees
              or charges that you will incur as a result of non-payment, late
              payment, or partial payment. PockBox has no control of knowledge
              of the loan details between you and your lender. Please refer to
              the late payment, partial payment, and non-payment policies
              detailed in the loan documents provided by your lender. PockBox
              does make an effort to work only with reputable lenders dedicated
