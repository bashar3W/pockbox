              At PockBox we work with multiple lenders to connect you with the
              short term funding you need to manage your emergency expenses.
              PockBox is not a lender, we connect you with a network of lender’s
              around the country who can provide you with quick loans regardless
              of your credit history.
            </p>
            <p class="section__content--para">
              Once you have submitted the information required in our quick and
              easy form, PockBox will attempt to connect you with a lender. If
              you are connected with a lender, you will receive an answer almost
              instantly in less than 5 minutes in most cases, unlike with other
              traditional banking institutions that may take days. If you are
              connected with a lender, you will be automatically redirected to
              the lender’s website where you should review the terms and
              conditions of your loan. You may also be contacted by your lending
              provider who will confirm you information and finalize your loan.
            </p>
            <p class="section__content--para">
              If you do not agree with any part of the terms and conditions of
              your loan, notify your lender before finalizing your loan. Your
              lender may contact you by phone or email. Be sure to respond in a
              timely manner in order to gain access to your funding as soon as
              possible.
            </p>

              Finally, personal loans are meant to be used as a short term
              solution only, please borrow responsibly.

          When you fill out forms on the PockBox website, we use that

          aggregators, which include Even Financial Corp. and RoundSky, Inc.,
          will collect additional information from you and potentially present
          loan offers to you within the PockBox website or application, however
