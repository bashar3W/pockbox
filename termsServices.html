                that any dispute, of any nature whatsoever, between you and us
                (including any claim against any of the Indemnified Parties)
                arising out of or relating to the Website, Services, or this
                Agreement, shall be decided by neutral, binding arbitration in
                accordance with the Commercial Rules then obtaining of the
                American Arbitration Association (AAA) in Las Vegas, Nevada
                (unless you and we mutually agree to a different forum or
                arbitrator). A final judgment or award by the arbitrator may
                then be duly entered and recorded by the prevailing party in the
                appropriate court as final judgment. The arbitrator may award
                costs (including, without limitation, the AAA fee and reasonable
                attorneys' fees) to the prevailing party. All disputes,
                including any representative claims, against Us and/or our
                related third parties shall be resolved by binding arbitration
                only on an individual basis with you.

                  Therefore, the arbitrator shall not conduct class arbitration;
                  that is, the arbitrator shall not allow you to serve as a
                  representative, as a private attorney general or in any other
                  representative capacity for others in the arbitration. The
                  arbitrator shall have no authority to: (a) conduct any
                  arbitration which is precluded by the preceding sentence or
                  (b) consolidate the claims of more than one claimant without
