              PockBox is not a direct lender; we provide a service that aims to
              quickly connect customers with lenders that offer loans that may
              work for them. Over the years PockBox has built a vast network of
              short term lenders who are able to provide customers with loans
              between $200 and $2,500. Many customers use short term loans to
              help with a wide range of emergency expenses. Unlike traditional
              personal loan stores, PockBox provides customers with a way to
              borrow money online without going into a store or waiting in line.
            </p>
            <p class="section__content--para">
              The online loan process is easy with PockBox. Customers visit
              www.pockbox.com, and fill out our application form. The
              application process is quick, taking less than five minutes to
              complete from start to finish. Our lenders do require certain
              personal information including your social security number,
              banking information, and so on. To learn how PockBox uses your
              personal information visit our Privacy Policy
            </p>
            <p class="section__content--para">
              Our application forms are safe and secure using 256bit SSL
              encryption to submit your sensitive information to our servers.
            </p>
            <p class="section__content--para">
              After an application has been submitted, PockBox will attempt to
              connect the applicant with a lender almost instantly. If you are
              approved for a personal loan you can receive the funds to your
              account in most cases within one business day. PockBox is not the
              lender, but does the work of connecting you with a lender. PockBox
              customers should always borrow responsibly. PockBox is not a
              lender, and cannot answer questions regarding your loan. Please
              review the terms of your loan before accepting. Review interest
              rates, and be aware of your due date. Should you have any
              questions about your loan, please contact your lender directly. If
              you have any questions regarding our services please visit our
